<p>"Much better than I expected. Simple idea, skillfully executed. Especially the chapter on self-deception … [and] medicine. … I found it too long, with later chapters spelling out again and again the same idea in different variations." 
Daniel Issing, <a href="https://medium.com/@issing.daniel/https-medium-com-issing-daniel-2018-books-ce5fc4f0c242">My Year in Books</a>, <i>Medium</i>, January 5, 2018. 

<p>"Although Elephant in the Brain is one the most cynical books I’ve read in quite a while, it is also one of the most interesting and provocative. … The idea that our deeper motivations are much more Machiavellian than we realize, and that we might actually be designed to self-deceive ourselves is not a fun theory, but it does seem to map onto reality better than most other explanations for sub-optimal behavior."

<p>"It’s newly published & Ogilvy recommended. What’s apparent, reading it is that evolutionary psychology helps to reframe familiar questions, making them appear in a new light."

<p>"There were three chapters that were engaging enough to make me forget that I didn't like the narrator: Religion, Education and Conspicuous Consumption. Art was pretty good too but not as compelling as the other three. I wouldn't recommend this to most people but it might be better to get the regular book and just read the good chapters!"

<p>"is a unique new title in that it dives directly into the way that human beings hide our motives for our actions, even from ourselves, and how much of a disruptive impact it has on every single aspect of our lives."

"You should read it, although I think most people don’t actually want to know its contents. … For that reason, I’m not sure this book will be popular. Most people write, and maybe think, based on slogans. … This book is likely to be read by weirdos who may not have much effect on the rest of society."
Jake Seliger, <a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2018/11/11/the-elephant-in-the-brain-robin-hanson-and-kevin-simler/">The Elephant in the Brain – Robin Hanson and Kevin Simler</a>, <i>The Story's Story</i>, November 11, 2018.

<p>"For the most part, don’t people really care about doing the right thing for the right reasons? According to Kevin Simler and Robin Hanson’s beautifully cynical new book, “Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life,” the answer to this question is an emphatic no." Dan Williams, <a href="">Am I The Sarah Huckabee Sanders Of My Brain?</a>, <i>Dan Williams Philosophy Blog</i>, August 26, 2018. 

<p>"After finishing this book I’ve been racking my brain trying to figure out why I didn’t think  in these terms before. All the pieces were there. Elephant didn’t bring me much new information but it hammered its point home over 400 pages." 
John Nerst, <a href="https://everythingstudies.com/2018/08/24/facing-the-elephant/">Facing the Elephant</a>, <i>Everything Studies</i>, August 24, 2018. 

<p>"Read with an open mind, it can not only raise questions about why humans act in certain ways, but also act as a call for institutions to be more honest about their motives, which could allow for better outcomes in a variety of fields."
Bryan Kam, <a href="http://msls.net/2018/08/16/the-elephant-in-the-brain/">The Elephant in the Brain</a>, <i>Museless Aiming </i>, August 16, 2018. 

<p>"At a time when accusations of 'bad faith' and 'virtue signaling' have become rampant on the internet, indicating a belief that our antagonists are not merely wrong but cynical and dishonest as well, the book offers a welcome reminder that much if not most of the time, we’re just honestly deluded." Park MacDougald, <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/08/what-youre-arguing-about-when-you-argue-about-politics.html">What You’re Really Arguing About When You Argue About Politics</a>, <i>Daily Intelligencer, New York Magazine</i>, August 15, 2018. 

<p>"Many of the details of Hanson and Simler’s thesis are persuasive, and the idea of an “introspective taboo” that prevents us from telling the truth to ourselves about our motives is worth contemplating. … Some of their most provocative ideas are in the area of education … I found that account painfully close to the reality of what modern schooling is like."
John Lanchester, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/07/23/can-economists-and-humanists-ever-be-friends">Can Economists and Humanists Ever Be Friends?</a>, <i>New Yorker</i>, July 23, 2018. 

<p>"a genuinely terrific book; … the bottom line is that I learned a lot (about others & about myself) and had a lot of fun along the way. There was never a moment when I wanted to put this book down." Steve Landsburg, <a href="http://www.thebigquestions.com/2018/07/17/the-elephant-in-the-brain/">The Elephant in the Brain</a>, <i>The Big Questions</i>, July 17, 2018.

<p>"For those with a contrarian bent, reading Hanson and co is like the sweetest crack cocaine. … This is the best book I’ve read so far this year."
Richard Meadows, <a href="https://thedeepdish.org/the-madness-of-crowds/">The Madness Of Crowds</a>, <i>Deep Dish</i>, July 9, 2018. Also, <a href="https://thedeepdish.org/best-books-2018/">The Best of the Best Books I Read in 2018</a>, <i>Deep Dish</i>, December 15, 2018. 

<p>"the most cheerfully cynical book I have read … successful people mostly already agree with the book’s core claim and behave accordingly, but explicit social consensus mostly denies or downplays particular instances of the claim" Paul Christiano, <a href="https://sideways-view.com/2018/07/08/the-elephant-in-the-brain/">The Elephant in the Brain</a>, <i>Sideways View</i>, July 8, 2018

<p>"Buy the book; its a great read. Fun read; fairly quick. It looks longer than it is. … They don't waste pages; its very concise; its a lot of information."
Nat Eliason, Neil Soni, <a href="https://madeyouthinkpodcast.com/the-elephant-in-the-brain-by-kevin-simler-and-robin-hanson/">Hidden Motives in Everyday Life. The Elephant in the Brain by Kevin Simler and Robin Hanson</a>, <i>Made You Think</i>, June 12, 2018.  

<p>"The argument that Simler and Hanson make is rather comprehensive, and compelling. … The Elephant in the Brain comprises 300-plus pages of academic rigor on the magic tricks of the mind against—and for the benefit of—itself." Katherine Oktober Matthews, <a href="http://ridingthedragon.life/2018/04/25/nevertheless-unable-to-escape-ourselves/">Nevertheless Unable to Escape Ourselves</a>, <i>Riding the Dragon</i>, April 25, 2018.

<p>"This is an intriguing book, very interesting and meant to be a little (or a lot) discomforting. … It is really fascinating, and well worth the read." Gretchen Wagner, <a href="https://tulsabookreview.com/product/the-elephant-in-the-brain-hidden-motives-in-everyday-life/">The Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life</a>, <i>Tulsa Book Review</i>, April, 2018. 

<p>"I simply enjoyed the book so much. … Analyses a multitude of points that seem quite distinct, but in reality all come together at the end." Anirudh Pai, <a href="https://lifeofapai.com/2018/04/09/slice-of-insight-elephant-in-the-brain/">Slice of Insight: The Elephant in the Brain</a>, <i></i>, April 9, 2018. 

<p>"Pretty great, especially given the authors&#39; own caveat that &#39;we are no doubt wrong in many places, not just in the details, but also in some larger conclusions&#39; and that &#39;to demonstrate that hidden motives are common and important&#39; they &#39;don’t need to be right about everything.&#39; Though I wish it was more clearly flagged that one key reason much of the book is likely wrong is just that the underlying research is false, as must be true for ~all books summarizing large amounts of &#39;soft&#39; science."

<p>"Some implications of the thesis of The Elephant in the Brain, may change the way we look at social sciences and help us see how to really leave others alone."

"A smart synthesis and offers several original metaphors. … Refreshingly frank and penetrating, leaving no stone of presumed human virtue unturned. The authors do not even spare themselves. … It is accessibly erudite."

<p>"very readable … there are some excellent passages, and some wonderful ideas, but there are also many ideas which are in sore need of greater defence. It's worth reading, quite possibly more than once, but it is not - in my view - Book-of-the-year level good."
